# Project Requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should accommodate. Functional requirements define the scope of the projects, and implementation details make sure all projects can be graded in the same way, while ensuring usefulness to a broad audience.

- [x] A general requirement is that your web app may not be based on code you wrote earlier or be similar to the projects you did in this or other courses (it must be a new project) and that you cannot do a project for which the requirements will be set by a third party (the project must be done for this course and not for anyone else).
Functional requirements

- [x] Your product should provide a solution for a clearly defined human problem and a clearly defined target audience.

- [Not Applicable]    Alternatively, your product may tell an interactive story or allow users to play a game.

- [x] Your product should be reasonably original with regards to apps that are available on the web these days.

- [x] Your product should embody good interaction design practices.

- [x] Your product’s design should fit well in the platform you’re using for layout, like Bootstrap.

- [x] Note: originality in this case should likely come from restricting your idea to a specific target audience, to a specific data set, or in some other way. Restraint can help you make your project fit in a few weeks and at the same time allow you to make it much better and more polished!

Implementation details

- [x] Your web application must utilize at least two of Flask, Django, JavaScript, and SQL.

- [x] Your web application must be sufficiently complex, as determined by the course’s instructor (not assistants).

- [x] Your web application must be mobile-responsive.

- [x] Your web application’s source code must be managed using git and be pushed to GitHub daily.

- [x] Your web application’s source code must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project to indicate that you wrote it (unless re-using a source file from another project).

- [x] Your web application must be shown running on the final day of the course.

- [x] Your web application must be reproducible on another computer by cloning the repository and following instructions in the README.

- [x] jQuery may not be used except to use standard functionality from web frameworks like Bootstrap.
